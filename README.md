# IOT-BASED-CONTACTLESS-BODY-TEMPERATURE-MONITORING-USING-RASPBERRY-PI
Interface an IR temperature sensor and if the temperature of any particular person exceeds the set value it will send the email alerts with the image of the person.

**Introduction**

- In the current wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, preventing and limiting the community spread of the virus ad become a mammoth task, with government and administrations across the world applying different strategies to restrict population movement and social interaction.

- In consequence a serious impact had fall on socio-economic. Due to Corona outbreak, it has become very difficult to identify those who are affected by virus or not.

**Components used**

Raspberry Pi
MLX90614 IR temperature sensor.
Pi camera.
Power supply
Connecting Wires

**Application**

We can use this contactless body temperature monitoring system at an entrance of our apartment, hospital, offices, shopping mall, transport stations and any other public places.
Â 
**Future scope**

- In future this system can extend with environment sensing mechanisms for adaptive building air conditioning and ventilation airborne protection in order to reduce the spread of coronavirus, especially during summer. 

- In-order to make the system more advanced, it would be by connecting more sensors to internet which measures various other health parameters and would be beneficial for public monitoring i.e. connecting all the objects to internet for quick and easy access.
